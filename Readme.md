Codechef submissions by bbackspace
==================================

This repo holds all submissions made by Joel M. Pinto (user bbackspace) on Codechef.

 - Top level directories are named by the contest codes.
 - Sub-directories hold the source codes and test input for each problem. Directory names correspond to the problem code.
 - For instance, the solution to the problem Cleaning Tables (http://www.codechef.com/AUG14/problems/CLETAB/) of the August long challenge can be found at AUG14/CLETAB/
 - Problems solved out of contests, i.e, in Practice mode, can be found in 'Practice' directory.
 - Directory 'helper code' contains template and code snippets.
 - Most submissions are in C++. You may find some easy practice problems' solutions in Java.
 - Note that if I haven't solved the problem on Codechef, the source code of the problem probably is a partial solution or a solution that times out or gives a Wrong Answer or Runtime Error verdict. This means that not all of the codes in this repo give an Accepted verdict. Proceed with caution!
